        Performs an out-of-band seek for a subscription to a

        these targets to cursors for each partition and
        orchestrates subscribers to start consuming messages
        from these seek cursors.

        If an operation is returned, the seek has been
        registered and subscribers will eventually receive
        messages from the seek cursors (i.e. eventual
        consistency), as long as they are using a minimum
        supported client library version and not a system that
        tracks cursors independently of Pub/Sub Lite (e.g.
        Apache Beam, Dataflow, Spark). The seek operation will
        fail for unsupported clients.

        If clients would like to know when subscribers react to
        the seek (or not), they can poll the operation. The seek
        operation will succeed and complete once subscribers are
        ready to receive messages from the seek cursors for all
        partitions of the topic. This means that the seek
        operation will not complete until all subscribers come
